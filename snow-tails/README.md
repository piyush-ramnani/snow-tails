# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Problems | Fixes | Learnings

-> All the static files are to be placed in the Public folder (That's how the browser picks static files in a react project)

-> Heading Font: League Spartan ✅
-> Other texts: Montserrat ✅
-> Letter spacing should match figma
-> Photos sections should be equal to text section (paddingm, marging, text size)
-> Check out comments in Figma
